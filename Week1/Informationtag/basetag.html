<!-- 
    -base tag gives the base url to all the relative urls of the page.So no need to give full path the file in that html document.
    -base tag can have only one tag of the html document page.If you give more base tag it will ignore all and take first tag only. if you use target attribute it will take the first place of those base tags rest of them will be ignored.
    -Target=_blank it will displayed in another tab opposite attribute is Target=_self(default one)
    -relative url-without included base url that is base url.Eg:http/images/demo1.jpg in this http/images is base url after the demo1.jpg is called relative url.
    -absolute url -full path Eg:http/images/demo1.jpg
