Absolute units:(px,cm,mm,in,pc,pt)
The absolute units always indicate a fixed length, while with the relative units the length is always calculated in relation to other elements.
-px stands for Pixel. Pixels can be defined as 1/96th part of an inch.
-pt stands for point. 1 CSS pt is defined as 1/72th of an inch
-pc stands for pica or picas. 1 CSS pt is defined as 1/6th of an inch.
-cm centimeters
-mm stands for millimeter.
-in stands for inch.
Relative units:(rem,em,%,ex,vh,vw,vmin,vmax)
-% This is the percentage unit. The measurement of the element is relative to the dimensions of the parent. Like if we set the width of an HTML element to be K% then its width is calculated as follows:
-1em refers to the default size of the property. So precisely, 1em is equivalent to 100%. (i.e 1em in case of plain text would be 16px if the root value is unaltered)
-rem rather stands for Root em.
This means the browser will ignore all the adjustments made to the parent elements and will scale the HTML element, to which the property is applied, based on the root/default value for that particular element.
-ch This unit sizes relative to the width of the digit ‘0’ as in parent. For plain text 1ch=8px (this is only true if the font-size of the parent element is unchanged from the default value of 16px.);
-vh This stands for view height. If we want our element to have exactly the same height as your viewport/ view window then use 100vh to denote that.
-vw stands for View Width. 100vw means 100% the width of the viewport/view window.
-Cmin 100vmin means the element changes are relative to 100% of the smaller dimension of the viewport (i.e 100% of the minimum of view height and view width).
-Cmax 100vmax means the element changes are relative to 100% of the larger dimension of the viewport (i.e 100% of maximum of the view height and the view width).
-Relative to the height of the letter ‘x’, 1ex would be equal to the length from the base of the letter ‘x’ to the intersection point.
