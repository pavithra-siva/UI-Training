        <p>Dosas originated in South India; their exact birthplace in that region is a matter of conjecture. According to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the Udupi town of present-day Karnataka.[1][2][3] However, there are also references according to food historian K. T. Achaya, that dosa (as dosai) was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature.[4] Nevertheless, Dosa is a dish whose origin is from the southern part of India.
            In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi restaurants.[1] Also, the Tamil dosai is softer and thicker. The thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka.[5] A recipe for dosa (as dosaka) can be found in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by the Chalukya king Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.[6]</p>
